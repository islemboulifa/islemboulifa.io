    <h2>A literature club, that's where the idea originated from, but it wasn't the main reason.</h2>
    <h2>The first and obvious one is: I love books and reading, so a personal library has always been on my mind.
    Secondly, I wanted to make something bigger than anything I have ever did before, at least for me.
    The idea was simple, though, building a website from scratch was no easy task,
    Still, I believe it was an excellent exercise and a memorable life experience. I've had the chance to learn a lot of php, totally new implementations of JavaScript,
    and test my HTML CSS knowledge.</h2>
    <h2>At the end, and after everything came together, worked as intended, it honestly gave me great pleasure,
    you could even say, a sense of accomplishment.</h2>
