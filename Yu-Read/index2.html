    <h2>This one is going to be containing high levels of cringe. Read at your own risk.</h2>

    <h2>So to kick things up, have you ever heard of DDLC? Probably no.</h2>
    <h2>If you did, congratulation, you have just played yourself. Go play it. It's a fun game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</h2>

    <h2>A literature club, that's where the idea originated from, but it wasn't the main reason.</h2>
    <h2>The first and obvious one is: I love books and reading, so a personal library has always been on my mind.
    Second: i wanted to make something bigger than anything i have ever did before, at least for me.
    The idea was simple, though, building a website from scratch was no easy task,
    in fact it made me question all of my life choices that led to this painfully tiring and worthless creation.
    Still, i believe it was an excellent exercise and a memorable life experience. I've had the chance to learn a lot of php, totally new implementations of JavaScript,
    and test my HTML CSS knowledge.</h2>
    <h2>At the end, and after everything came together, worked as intended, it honestly gave me great pleasure,
    you could even say, a sense of accomplishment.</h2>
    <h2> I might even sell this. <img src="emoticon.png" alt=""></h2>
